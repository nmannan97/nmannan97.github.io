		<H3>About me:</H3>
		<IMG SRC = "AboutMePics.jpg" ALT = "Beach pic" width = "200" height = "200" style = "float: left">
		I enjoy things such as going to the comedy club while in my time during SJSU.
		I enjoyed making my own jokes and telling them week after week to spark creativity
		and practice my public speaking skills. Outside of school I enjoyed my time biking around the 
		trails in San Jose including the Guadalupe river trail, the Los Gatos Creek trail, 
		and the Coyote Creek trail. Other than those I enjoy creating dishes and tinkering 
		with electronics and coding in my spare time. Also a former Boy Scout that ended in
		honors with the Eagle Scout award.

		<P><H2><B> Projects </B></H2></P>
		<OL>
			<LI>Robotics</LI>
			<P><H5> Meetings with interdisciplinary engineers, my part
			included designing and populating PCBs for the drive system in DipTrace
			including designing a schematic and then putting it all together on a PCB
			.This included using MOSFET switching to convert 3V3 to 5V using an 
			ESP 32 WROOM.
			</H5></P>

			<IMG SRC = "PCB,RevC2.jpg" ALT = "PCB, one on top of another" width = "241" height = "251"> 
			<p> </p>
			<br>
			
			<LI>Mechatronics</LI>
			<H5> 
			Using an Arduino UNO to build an RFID doggie door using Master Slave
			communication protocol to open a door using a motor. My part was to do
			some minor coding as well as make the electrical connections from 
			microcontroller to other components. 
			</H5>
				<video width = "320" height = "180" controls>
					<source src = "demo.mp4" type = "video/mp4"> 
				</video>
			<p> </p><br>
			<LI>Senior design project</LI>
			<P><H5> Meeting with a group of other electrical engineers to build a 
			project to locate an unknown RF transmitter, specifically for drones 
			operating at 2.4 GHz. I did some debugging and figuring out how some of the 
			firmware worked as well as build some PCBs and design some case for protection
			of outer elements. 
			</H5></P>
			
			<LI>Embedded systems final</LI>
			<P><H5> Meeting with a group of other embedded systems engineers to design a 
			system that would rev up a motor to 1500 RPM controlled with a keypad using FreeRTOS, 
			PID systems,interrupts hiearchy, and timmer counters; all done on a SAMD20 through 
			ATMEL studios.
			</H5></P>
			
			<LI>Microwave engineering final</LI>
			<P><H5> Duo project where I designed and built a radar dish, while my partner did 
			the simulations for the project in HFSS. Along with this I designed a system that 
			would take sample points every 1 degree and then put the average of 5 samples into
			an excel file. This used a Python script to collect data and an Arduino using RTOS
			to take accurate and communicate via serial communications. Made my own Software 
			Defined Radio, <em>SDR</em>.
			</H5></P>

			<IMG SRC = "RadarDish1.PNG" ALT = "Radar Side" width = "241" height = "251">
			<p> </p>
			<br>
			<LI>Verilog final</LI>
			<P><H5> A group of design engineers making hardware using RTL CAD software in Vivado 
			and then using an eclipse based SDK to control the hardware to play a song called Daisy
			Bell. 
			</H5></P>
			
			<LI>Self designed Pipboy 3000</LI>
			<P><H5> Self designed Pipboy 3000 in Creo Parametrics to hold a Nokia touch screen phone
			during my first winter break at SJSU. See my GrabCad for more.

			<IMG SRC = "PipBoy1.PNG" ALT = "Radar Side" width = "241" height = "251">			
			</P></H5>
			
			<LI>My website</LI>
			<P><H5> Self made website using HTML that I decided to do during my free time after I graduated
			since I was curious about learning the HTML language and some web development as well as to 
			showcase my skills and projects during my time in SJSU.  
			</P></H5>
			
			<LI>CRM project</LI>
			<P><H5> Duo project with a friend from college including working with React, CSS, JavaScript
			and Python to make a functioning management app. My part includes working on webscraping 
			applications to find suitable candidates using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to look for groups.
			This included weekly meetings remotely and some gatherings to work on the project in person.
			</P></H5>
			<br>
			
			<LI>Robotic leg</LI>
			<P><H5> Individual robotic leg project where I designed a leg like structure and used a 
			microcontroller to move the leg up and down with a linear actuator. This used CREO parametrics
			to design the leg and a 3D printer to build the parts in PLA and rubber. Looking to do more 
			with it and include servo motors to move the leg when I get more funds. 
			</P></H5>
			<video width = "180" height = "320" controls>

			</video>
			<br>
			
			<LI>Globalfoundries GUI</LI>
			<P><H5> Project done at my internship which included doing some machine learning to pick up 
			variables in a .lib file and then develop a truth table automatically for any standard cell 
			that was picked up. This was to make a datasheet automatically and build it quickly, but also
			the GUI would check the consistancy of cells between Verilog files and lef files or Verilog 
			and library files. This was to give a quality assurance and increase the integrity of the 
			company's products.
