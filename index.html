			<ul>
				<li>Western Digitial; Test engineer; July, 2020 - Feburary, 2022</li>
				<p class = 'fontSizeLarge'>Worked on the latest silicon that Western digital produced. Used skills in coding to work with testing equipment made by the company in C and
					helped automate many of the processes including the set up procedures using Python. Some of the projects I worked on included making a GUI to
					automate the running of scripts on a tester and another GUI to automatically set up a coding enviornment and firmware.  
				</p>

				<li>Unlocked Reality; Hardware engineer; Jan, 2021 - September, 2021</li>
				<p class = 'fontSizeLarge'>Worked with a company to build hardware for virtual reality accessories. This included using CAD, such as Fusion360, to build object for manufacturing
					and objects to be 3D printed. This included working with individual pieces and then putting them into an assembly. Along with mechanical design
					I also built electronics such as a pressure pad to detect a person's pressure on a flexible PCB. This included designing a foot shaped PCB, size 10
					men's, and a control board to control all the electronics. Finally I write some code to include RTOS in the company code so that everything 
					runs well. 
				</p>

				<li>Globalfoundries; QA engineer; October, 2019 - Feburary 1st, 2020</li>
				<p class = 'fontSizeLarge'>
					Worked on a GUI with python to make documentation of specific logic gates easier and more automated. This included using some machine learning 
					to parse for information and write them to a word document. This was done by taking a .lib file and a .v file and comparing their inputs and 
					outputs to their names to see if the pins matched up. Finally the .lib file was run through an ML machine that would parse the information and 
					put the technical specs, a picture of the logic gate, and an autogenerated truth table. This was meant to be written for each component of upcoming 
					logic gates and sent to customers quickly, as well as do a quality check on all logic gates.

		I enjoy things such as going to the comedy club while in my time during SJSU.
		I enjoyed making my own jokes and telling them week after week to spark creativity
		and practice my public speaking skills. Outside of school I enjoyed my time biking around the 
		trails in San Jose including the Guadalupe river trail, the Los Gatos Creek trail, 
		and the Coyote Creek trail. Other than those I enjoy creating dishes and tinkering 
		with electronics and coding in my spare time. Also a former Boy Scout that ended in
		honors with the Eagle Scout award.

		<OL>

			<LI>Robotic leg</LI>
			<P class = 'fontSizeLarge'>Individual robotic leg project where I designed a leg like structure and used a 
			microcontroller to move the leg up and down with a linear actuator. This used CREO parametrics
			to design the leg and a 3D printer to build the parts in PLA and rubber. Looking to do more 
			with it and include servo motors to move the leg when I get more funds. Hover over the picture to view the gif.

			<LI>Microwave engineering final</LI>
			<P class = 'fontSizeLarge'> Duo project where I designed and built a radar dish, while my partner did 
			the simulations for the project in HFSS. Along with this I designed a system that 
			would take sample points every 1 degree and then put the average of 5 samples into
			an excel file. This used a Python script to collect data and an Arduino using RTOS
			to take accurate and communicate via serial communications. Hover over the picture to view the gif. <em>SDR</em>.

			<LI>Cmpe243 final project app</LI>
			<P class = 'fontSizeLarge'>Group project where my part was to build an app to connect a microcontroller to an app
			by using a bluetooth module. This project was particularly difficult because the app was built 
			with react and coded with JS and python with flask. On top of that the bluetooth module was from 
			an arduino kit and the microcontroller was designed by the professor so I had to synchronize them 
			to make sure the computer was actually getting data from it. 
			<br/>
			<Br/>
			This project was particularly rewarding because it helped me learn about Javascript from the internet
			and the react framework. This also introduced me to flask as a backend and how to connect devices Made
			from Arduinos to work with other components. 
			<br/>
			<Br/>
			In the end, this project taught me how to make an app for the web that would include google-maps, connect to a
			bluetooth device, and update the website with flask to output data for people to read. 
			</P></H5>

			<LI>Robotics</LI>
			<P class = 'fontSizeLarge'> Meetings with interdisciplinary engineers, my part
			included designing and populating PCBs for the drive system in DipTrace
			including designing a schematic and then putting it all together on a PCB
			.This included using MOSFET switching to convert 3V3 to 5V using an 
			ESP 32 WROOM.

			<LI class = 'fontSizeLarge'>Mechatronics</LI>
			<p class = 'fontSizeLarge'> 
			Using an Arduino UNO to build an RFID doggie door using Master Slave
			communication protocol to open a door using a motor. My part was to do
			some minor coding as well as make the electrical connections from 
			microcontroller to other components.

			<LI>Globalfoundries GUI</LI>
			<P class = 'fontSizeLarge'> Project done at my internship which included doing some machine learning to pick up 
			variables in a .lib file and then develop a truth table automatically for any standard cell 
			that was picked up. This was to make a datasheet automatically and build it quickly, but also
			the GUI would check the consistancy of cells between Verilog files and lef files or Verilog 
			and library files. This was to give a quality assurance and increase the integrity of the 
			company's products.

			<LI>Project Script Automation Like A Machine (SALAM)</LI>
			<P class = 'fontSizeLarge'> Script automation for running scripts by emulating clicking and mouse movement in Python
			to get a machine to run directory of scripts. It would run multiple scripts in one sitting and then report the outcome
			onto a CSV for users to see pass/fail.	
				</P>	
			<br>

			<LI>Remote Oscilloscope project</LI>
			<P class = 'fontSizeLarge'> Used VISA communications to send commands to an oscilloscope to take measurements. The code 
				was wrapped in a Python GUI using TKinter so the user could just point, click, and press to run the machine. This 
				would then run, and collect data and plot them on Matplotlib for easy analysis. This was also made remote through 
				remote computers so that tests could be taken away from the machine.

			<LI>Senior design project</LI>
			<P><H5> Meeting with a group of other electrical engineers to build a 
			project to locate an unknown RF transmitter, specifically for drones 
			operating at 2.4 GHz. I did some debugging and figuring out how some of the 
			firmware worked as well as build some PCBs and design some case for protection
			of outer elements. 
			</H5></P>

			<LI>My website</LI>
			<P><H5> Self made website using HTML that I decided to do during my free time after I graduated
			since I was curious about learning the HTML language and some web development as well as to 
			showcase my skills and projects during my time in SJSU.  
			</P></H5>

			<LI>Verilog final</LI>
			<P><H5> A group of design engineers making hardware using RTL CAD software in Vivado 
			and then using an eclipse based SDK to control the hardware to play a song called Daisy
			Bell. 
			</H5></P>
			
			<LI>Embedded systems final</LI>
			<P><H5> Meeting with a group of other embedded systems engineers to design a 
			system that would rev up a motor to 1500 RPM controlled with a keypad using FreeRTOS, 
			PID systems,interrupts hiearchy, and timmer counters; all done on a SAMD20 through 
			ATMEL studios.
			</H5></P>
			
			<LI>CRM project</LI>
			<P><H5> Duo project with a friend from college including working with React, CSS, JavaScript
			and Python to make a functioning management app. My part includes working on webscraping 
			applications to find suitable candidates using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to look for groups.
			This included weekly meetings remotely and some gatherings to work on the project in person.
